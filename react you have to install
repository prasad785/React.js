Live editing: Allows React components to be live reloaded.
ESLint: Analyzes source code to report programming errors, bugs, and syntax errors.
Prettier: Enforces a consistent style for indentation, spacing, semicolons and quotes, etc.
Babel: Compiles JSX into Regular JavaScript
Webpack: Stitches together a group of modules into a single file (or group of files). This process is called Bundling.
